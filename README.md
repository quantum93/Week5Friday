#### Super Galactic Age Calculator. 6/28/2019

#### By **Tae Lee**

## Description
A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days. Write an application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years. I will use the Javascript Date object. I will not build a UI for this application. Instead, focus on thoroughly testing each piece of functionality. I will do at least one test for each spec and commit my specs before starting to code.

### Specs
